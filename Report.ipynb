    "Although the pandemic seems to be easing out here in Australia, it cannot be said that it is the same everywhere. Many countries are still suffering under the hands of this epidemic and Australians now being wary of travel due of safety issues, therefore we wanted to ensure that our users were aware of the current conditions of the location they wanted to visit. Moreover, we understand that due to COVID-19 cases and travel restrictions that are still yet to be lifted in many countries, they might not be able to travel to their destination of choice. Hence, we also wanted to provide recommendations based on their dream destination and/or factors (even outside of COVID-19) that travellers in general are interested in - including but not limited to nature, food, infrastructure, arts, etc. We wanted to create an application that incorporates the pandemic with the travel industry (which was very heavily affected by COVID-19) to show our users that travelling can still be the rewarding and joyous experience that it once used to be."

    "### Question formulation\n",
    "Initially we were inspired by the OWID data to plan to analyse things like the effect of variant dominance on vaccination effectiveness, however, later we realized that facts about COVID-19 or vaccinations may no longer be the centre topic of normal people, as COVID-19 has been existing for more than 2 years, there are already different types of dashboards around the world for people to obtain the latest information about COVID, and for the policy makers, they need more sophisticated research on COVID and vaccinations which are more suitable for epidemiologists and pharmacists to conduct, therefore, we as a interdisciplinary group which mainly consists of people from data science filed, decided to look at systems that have been affected by COVID-19 and explore what we can do for the post-COVID world. \n",
    "\n",
    "We firstly listed several affected systems including Food(restaurants/take-outs), Entertainment(music festivals/concerts/plays), Travel, Employment and Transportation. After discussions and brief investigations， we have chosen to focus on the travel system among those affected systems. The key factor in making that choice is, for other affected systems, we got difficulty in collecting diverse and useful data, besides, it is noticeable that one thing COVID-19 has brought to the world is the severe declines in global mobility. In past 2 years, many countries temporarily locked their borders while also carrying out different levels of lockdowns within borders to prevent epidemic outbreaks, hence, under the situation that finally the world is reopening, people are eager to plan their tours. So we started to aim at making an application for people nowadays to choose the most satisfying travelling destinations. As the requirements for Australian citizens and permanent residents to get the individual travel exemption have been relaxed since April, Australians are free to go for an outside-border travel in most cases, therefore, Australian residents are supposed to be the most suitable users for this application. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once our main aim and target audience have been decided, the main question of our project is also formulated - how to recommend Australian people with the best overseas travel destinations no matter they have initial interests or not."

For example, the COVID variable group included the variables `new_cases_smoothed_per_million` and `new_deaths_smoothed_per_million` in our integrated dataset. Increasing the weighting of features that the user was interested in ensured that our recommendations placed more emphasis on these features, and thus were tailored to each user's preferences.\n",

    "After each 10-NN model had been run for the user-specified country, we considered the corresponding 9 sets of neighbours. We then returned the 10 neighbours which were the most common across all 9 neighbour sets, as the final recommendations to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Size-constrained k-means clustering - user does not specify country of interest\n",
    "\n",
    "In our UI, if the user did not select a country of interest, then we used size-constrained k-means clustering across all countries in our dataset to determine the 10-12 countries most suited to their interests.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each cluster produced by size-constrained k-means clustering (a modification of k-means clustering, explained in more detail below), we determined its average rating across all interests specified by the user (if the user did not specify any interests, then we simply took the average rating across _all_ features in our integrated dataset). For all possible interests except COVID, a higher rating meant that the country had a higher standard for this interest. However, for COVID, clearly lower, rather than higher, case/death numbers are preferable. Thus, for each COVID variable (there were two - cases and deaths), the value for each country was subtracted from the max value for this variable. This transformation ensured that higher values (differences from max) were preferable - consistent with all other variables. We then returned the cluster with the highest average rating as countries recommended to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of what size-constrained k-means clustering is, it is a modification of k-means clustering proposed by researchers at Microsoft Research and the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, which would allow a minimum cluster size to be specified (Bradley et al., 2000). The package we have used to perform size-constrained k-means clustering, k-means-constrained (Levy-Kramer, 2022), extends upon the work of Bradley et al. (2000) by also allowing a _maximum_ cluster size to be specified. We specified a minimum cluster size of 10 and a maximum of 12, as we felt that this number of recommendations would give the user a certain degree of variety without overwhelming them with too many options. Using _size-constrained_ k-means clustering, as opposed to standard k-means clustering, eliminated the possibility of having unevenly-sized clusters - with a worst case situation being that only 1 country was recommended to the user (clearly not enough variety to choose from)."

Through this we found that our recommendation were often similar to what others were suggesting. While there wasn't 100% similarity, there generally weren't any abnormal suggestions from our algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "Although it is worth noting that this evaluation method was purely a sense check. There were many limitations to this as it was difficult to find online recommendations which matched our specific user interests. Therefore it was simply used to double check if we had any outliers in certain suggestions."

    "### Deployment Process ####\n",
    "Our deployment process consisted of several steps: planning, development, testing, and deployment of the final product. These steps are closely based on the PMKBOK Process Groups, widely used in project management domains.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Planning ####\n",
    "Our planning phase was multifaceted. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, we had to identify and acquire data from multiple sources. This included static sources such as reports, and dynamic constantly updating sources such as APIs and RSS feeds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we formulated the ensemble KNN and k-means size-constrained clustering algorithms. This was done through a combination of our own research and in consultation with the DATA3888 tutoring team. \n",
    "\n",
    "We then prototyped the dashboard design using wireframes and wireflows on paper and subsequently on the Figma web application. Prototyping in this way is a key process in the User Interface and User Experience disciplines. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Development #### \n",
    "Our team then split into two discrete teams: an analytics team, and a UI group. We made use of GitHub in order to facillitate code sharing and collaboration. Both teams used a singular repository with multiple branches. \n",
    "\n",
    "The analytics code utilised the scikit-learn, numpy, pandas and k-means-constrained libraries, while the UI component was implemented using the Plotly Dash Python libraries and the Dash Extensions Python library. The UI elements were implemented using the Bulma CSS framework. The dashboard and code are served by a Flask server.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analytics code and basic UI implementation were completed in parallel, with the teams working together in the last stage to implement application callbacks in order to utilise the analytics functionality within the dashboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Testing ####\n",
    "Testing was performed during all stages of development in an ad-hoc manner. Using a range of inputs into the dashboard, including normal input and edges cases, (nothing selected, everything selected, etc.) subsequent outputs were checked for consistent results and callback errors (provided via the Plotly Dash debug mode).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Deployment and Showcase of the Final Product #### \n",
    "After integration and final testing, the server was put into production mode. A feature of the application is that on initial startup, it fetches the most up-to-date information from our data sources. The application is run using `main.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A user will be first be greeted with a variety of options allowing them to select a destnation on interest, possible concerns, and travel interests. The subsequent results are based on the interests and concerns that the user selects. The travel recommendation system then provides ten to twelve destination recommendations, with their geographical locations highlighted on a map of the world.\n",
