    "Once all datasets had been integrated, we weighted by a factor of 1000 the features which the user was interested in. Importantly, in our UI, the user did not directly select individual features in our dataset; rather, they selected \"variable groups\", where each variable group corresponded to several features in our dataset. For example, the COVID variable group included the variables `new_cases_smoothed_per_million` and `new_deaths_smoothed_per_million` in our integrated dataset. Increasing the weighting of features that the user was interested in ensured that our recommendations placed more emphasis on these features, and thus were tailored to each user's preferences.\n",

    "For each cluster produced by size-constrained k-means clustering (a modification of k-means clustering, explained in more detail below), we determined its average rating across all interests specified by the user (if the user did not specify any interests, then we simply took the average rating across _all_ features in our integrated dataset). For all possible interests except COVID, a higher rating meant that the country had a higher standard for this interest. However, for COVID, clearly lower, rather than higher, case/death numbers are preferable. Thus, for each COVID variable (there were two - cases and deaths), the value for each country was subtracted from the max value for this variable. This transformation ensured that higher values (differences from max) were preferable - consistent with all other variables. We then returned the cluster with the highest average rating as countries recommended to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of what size-constrained k-means clustering is, it is a modification of k-means clustering proposed by researchers at Microsoft Research and the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, which would allow a minimum and maximum cluster size to be specified. We specified a minimum cluster size of 10 and a maximum of 12, as we felt that this number of recommendations would give the user a certain degree of variety without overwhelming them with too many options. Using _size-constrained_ k-means clustering, as opposed to standard k-means clustering, eliminated the possibility of having unevenly-sized clusters - with a worst case situation being that only 1 country was recommended to the user (clearly not enough variety to choose from)."
