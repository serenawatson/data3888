Importantly, in our UI, the user did not directly select individual features in our dataset; rather, they selected \"variable groups\", where each variable group corresponded to several features in our dataset. For example, the COVID variable group included the variables `new_cases_smoothed_per_million` and `new_deaths_smoothed_per_million` in our integrated dataset. Increasing the weighting of features that the user was interested in ensured that our recommendations placed more emphasis on these features, and thus were tailored to each user's preferences.\n",

    "Our Holiday Planner app incorporated two models - an ensemble 10-NN model, and a size-constrained k-means clustering model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ensemble 10-NN - user specifies country of interest\n",
    "\n",
    "In our UI, if the user did select a country of interest, then we used ensemble 10-NN to determine the 10 most similar countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our ensemble 10-NN model consisted of 9 10-NN models, each of which used a different distance metric. The 9 distance metrics we used are listed below:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Euclidean\n",
    "2. Manhattan\n",
    "3. Chebyshev\n",
    "4. Cosine\n",

    "Each 10-NN model was given the country selected by the user, and returned this country's 10 nearest neighbours (10 most similar countries) as determined by its assigned distance metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "After each 10-NN model had been run for the user-specified country, we considered the corresponding 9 sets of neighbours. We then returned the 10 neighbours which were the most common across all 9 neighbour sets, as the final recommendations to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Size-constrained k-means clustering - user does not specify country of interest\n",
    "\n",
    "In our UI, if the user did not select a country of interest, then we used size-constrained k-means clustering across all countries in our dataset to determine the 10-12 countries most suited to their interests.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each cluster produced by size-constrained k-means clustering (a modification of k-means clustering, explained in more detail below), we determined its average rating across all interests specified by the user (if the user did not specify any interests, then we simply took the average rating across _all_ features in our integrated dataset). For all possible interests except COVID, a higher rating meant that the country had a higher standard for this interest. However, for COVID, clearly lower, rather than higher, case/death numbers are preferable. Thus, for each COVID variable (there were two - cases and deaths), the value for each country was subtracted from the max value for this variable. This transformation ensured that higher values (differences from max) were preferable - consistent with all other variables. We then returned the cluster with the highest average rating as countries recommended to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of what size-constrained k-means clustering is, it is a modification of k-means clustering proposed by researchers at Microsoft Research and the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, which would allow a minimum and maximum cluster size to be specified. We specified a minimum cluster size of 10 and a maximum of 12, as we felt that this number of recommendations would give the user a certain degree of variety without overwhelming them with too many options. Using _size-constrained_ k-means clustering, as opposed to standard k-means clustering, eliminated the possibility of having unevenly-sized clusters - with a worst case situation being that only 1 country was recommended to the user (clearly not enough variety to choose from)."

    "When evaluating our 10 nearest-neighbours ensemble, we decided to calculate the similarity score and explore how stable our model was. Due to the numerous combinations of user inputs we may get, we had to take a random sample of user inputs. Therefore we calcuated the country recommendations for a randomly selected combination of 5 countries and 3 interest inputs, 15 samples all together. For each combination of inputs, we then calculated the recommendation with both the full model and when one distance metric was removed. An example of a interation could be found below, where the column title is the removed metric, compared to the full model.\n",

    "For the size-constrained clustering, we decided to utilise a silhouette score to determine the model’s goodness of fit.

We then clustered on each of the resulting combinations and collected all silhouette scores. \n",

As no results fell close to or below zero, this would suggests that the clusters are different from one another. However as it is very much below 1, our clusters are still not as clearly distinguished or significantly different from one another. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Qualitative Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "As a qualitative measure, we also compared our result to travel recommendations made by travel writers and websites. This was to compare our subjective recommendation with popular opinion and suggestions from travel professionals. \n",
    "\n",
    "We compared the countries listed on our recommender with other countries listed on blogs or recommendation websites with similar interests (e.g. travelling in Europe or best countries for museums). Through this we found that our recommendation were often similar to what others were suggesting. While there wasn't 100% similarity, there generally weren't any abnormal suggestions from our algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "Although it is worth noting that this evaluation method was purely a sense check. There were many limitations to this as it was difficult to find online recommendations which matched our specific user interests. Therefore it was simply used to double check if we had any outliers in certain suggestions."
