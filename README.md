# DATA3888 COVID C4

To run our Plotly dash app, use the following command (for this command to work you must be in the `data3888` directory):

`python3 app/main.py`

If the above command doesn't work, alternatively you can try `python app/main.py`. However, we do not recommend this as it can accidentally run python2, whereas python3 is required
to run our Plotly dash app.

The requirements file stating all package versions required to run our app is located at `app/requirements.txt`.
