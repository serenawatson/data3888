ALB,"Albania (Albanian: Shqipëria) is a country in the Balkans with unspoiled beaches, mountainous landscapes, traditional cuisine, archaeological artifacts, unique traditions, low prices and the wild atmosphere of the countryside. It is one of the sunniest countries in Europe. The country has an extensive archaeological heritage; it was part of Ancient Greece, the Roman Empire and the Ottoman Empire until its first declaration of independence in 1912, becoming a kingdom and then a communist dictatorship before becoming a democratic republic. Albania is one of the few majority Muslim nations in Europe."
DZA,"Algeria (Arabic: الجزائر, French: Algérie) is a country in North Africa on the Mediterranean. The largest country in Africa, it has a fantastic diversity of landscapes, an extremely rich cultural legacy (boasting no less than 7 World Heritage sites), and beautiful beaches. Algeria is overlooked by many travellers, but if you do intend to visit, know that there are a great number of opportunities in this relatively unexplored country."
ARG,"Argentina is a large country in the southern part of South America. It offers a great diversity of climates and landscapes from jungles in the north, great grass plains in the centre and frozen mountains in the south."
ARM,"Armenia (Armenian: Հայաստան Hayastan) is a landlocked country in the Caucasus. Once the center of an empire, this former Soviet republic straddles the line between Europe and Asia. Armenia has a rich, ancient history, and it is most famously known for being the first country in the world to adopt Christianity as an official religion."
AUT,"Austria (German: Österreich, literally ""the Eastern Realm"" or ""Eastern Empire"") is a landlocked alpine German-speaking country in Central Europe. Austria, along with neighbouring Switzerland, is the winter sports centre of Europe. However, it is just as popular for summer tourists who visit its historic cities and villages and hike in the magnificent scenery of the Alps."
AZE,"Azerbaijan (Azerbaijani: Azərbaycan) is a former Soviet republic in the Caucasus and variously considered part of Europe or Asia. It is nicknamed the Land of Fire. Initially a part of the Persian Empire, the country was ceded to the Russian Empire in the late 19th century."
BHR,"The Kingdom of Bahrain (Arabic: البحرين‎, al-Baḥrayn) is a Middle Eastern archipelago in the Persian Gulf, tucked into a pocket of the sea flanked by Saudi Arabia and Qatar. It displays relative social liberalism compared with more conservative neighbouring countries, where Islamic law is applied in a much stricter way. Case in point: alcohol is legal here. Although Bahrain has a heavily petroleum-based economy, its political, social, and cultural peculiarities helped it develop a fairly cosmopolitan middle class and a politically conscious working class."
BGD,"The People's Republic of Bangladesh (Bengali: গণপ্রজাতন্ত্রী বাংলাদেশ, Gônôprôjatôntri Bangladesh) is a nation in South Asia, on the edge of the Indian subcontinent. It is nearly completely surrounded by India, but it also has a small land border with Myanmar.  Bangladesh is one of the most homogenous countries in the world; Bengalis make up 98% of the population, and the country is believed to have the world's highest population density. The vast majority of Bengalis (nearly 90%) in Bangladesh are Sunni Muslims and the country has one of the largest Muslim populations the world.  Formerly a part of the British Empire and India, Bangladesh became a part of Pakistan during the partition of India, and in the 1970s, it became an independent nation. The country is endowed with pristine beaches, numerous archaeological sites, bustling markets, numerous sites of religious importance, forests, delicious food, and more importantly, hospitable and friendly people. There's plenty to do in this small, densely populated country."
BRB,"Barbados is an island in the Caribbean region, but which lies out in the Atlantic many miles east of the Caribbean Sea. Its nearest neighbours, some 100 miles (160 km) west, are Saint Vincent and Saint Lucia, part of the arc of the Lesser Antilles that separate Atlantic and Caribbean. Those islands look like and are a partly-submerged chain of mountains. By contrast Barbados has formed from deposits of coral and has a gentler landscape. It's fertile, and is sometimes called ""Bimshire"" or the ""Little Britain"" of the Caribbean because of its long and uniquely unbroken history of British colonisation and settlement. It became independent in 1966 and tourism is nowadays its main industry."
BEL,"A low-lying country in the Benelux, Belgium (Dutch: België, French: Belgique, German: Belgien) sits at the crossroads of Western Europe. It marries the historical landmarks for which the continent is famous with spectacular modern architecture and rural idylls. Its capital, Brussels, is home to the headquarters of the European Union. Although Belgium is a relatively wealthy country, it is also one of the most politically complex countries in the world. Differences in language and culture between Flanders (the Dutch speaking portion) and Wallonia (the French speaking portion) have lead to several far-reaching reforms, and this continuing antagonism makes Belgian politics so complex that even ordinary Belgians aren't able to make sense of what's truly going on. Despite this all, the two halves form a country that contains some of Europe's most attractive and historical cities, and is a true 'must-see' for any visitor to the continent."
BOL,"Bolivia is a beautiful, geographically rich, and multiethnic country in the heart of South America, visited for its stunning mountain landscapes and vibrant indigenous culture."
BWA,"Botswana is a landlocked country in Southern Africa. Its economy, one of the most robust on the continent, is dominated by diamond mining and tourism. Botswana is famous for its wildlife, and areas like Tsodilo Hills, Chobe National Park, Moremi Game Reserve in the Okavango Delta, and the Central Kalahari Game Reserve have a very high concentration of game. The bulk of the Kalahari desert falls within Botswana's borders and Botswana is home to most of the world's San (Bushman) population."
BRA,"Brazil (Portuguese: Brasil) is the largest country in South America and the fifth largest in the world. Brazil is an incredibly diverse country, in people, culture, and landscapes—from the famous summer carnaval in Rio de Janeiro, Salvador, Olinda, and Recife to the wild power of nature in the Amazon and Iguaçu Falls. You'll find bustling cities, laid-back beaches, and traditional lifestyles, often right next to each other. Brazilian culture, which varies substantially across the country, comes from an international mix of European colonizers, African and Asian communities (notably in Salvador and São Paulo, respectively), and indigenous influence throughout the country."
BGR,"Bulgaria, officially the Republic of Bulgaria (Bulgarian: Република България), is a country in the Balkans, west of the Black Sea. Bulgaria boasts sublime beaches on its seaside, lovely churches and winter sport opportunities in its mountains, as well as a unique combination of architectural styles in each of its cities and towns. A medium-sized country (approximately the size of Cuba, Portugal or the state of Virginia), Bulgaria offers a wide diversity of landscapes, as well has numerous historical sites, each possessing its own unique beauty. Because of this all, there is a great number of tourism opportunities in the country."
KHM,"The Kingdom of Cambodia (កម្ពុជា) is in Southeast Asia. While Angkor Wat commemorates Cambodia's glorious history, the country has been ravaged by colonialism, the Indochina Wars, and the Khmer Rouge regime, and is today one of Asia's poorest countries."
CMR,"Cameroon (French: Cameroun) is a country in Central Africa. While not the largest country in Africa, in some ways Cameroon is as large as Africa itself. Western tourism is rare, though most of the country's tourists do come from Europe (predominantly Belgium). Cameroon is a diverse and multi-ethnic country. Known as ""Africa in Miniature"" it has French- and English-speaking portions, Muslim- and Christian-dominated regions, the tallest mountain in Central Africa and terrain that includes rain forest, desert plains, mountains and high plateau."
CAN,"Canada is the world's second largest country by area, behind only Russia. Nicknamed the Great White North, Canada is renowned for its vast untouched landscape, and its multicultural heritage. While much of Canada consists of forests, it also has more lakes than any other country, the Rocky Mountains, the Prairies, and a sparsely populated archipelago extending into the Arctic."
CHL,"Chile narrowly stretches along the southern half of the west coast of South America, between the Andes and the Pacific Ocean. It is an amazing country, from the dry Atacama Desert to the cold of Chilean Patagonia."
CHN,"China (中国; Zhōngguó) is one of the world's oldest civilizations. Its long and rich history is present in people's thinking and values, and in the art, architecture, and feats of engineering that remain from dynasties past. After a tumultuous 20th century, China has dramatically re-emerged as an economic powerhouse. Its rapid development has been paralleled by an ascent onto the international stage as a global superpower. Of course there are growing pains when high-rises and factories surge up to dwarf centuries-old pagodas, but there's also a strong sense of enthusiasm and optimism about what the future holds. If you visit now, you can see the relics of millennia of history and experience the signs of further transformations in progress."
COL,"Colombia occupies the northwest corner of South America. It has an area twice that of France and almost twice Texas, with long coasts on the Caribbean and the Pacific oceans, mountainous regions, and Amazon jungle areas inland. The ethnic groups and cultures are diverse. The country has something to offer almost any traveller. Pick a climate, and it's yours—if you find the light jacket weather of Bogotá cold, drive an hour down through the mountains and sunbathe next to the pool of your rented hacienda. If you don't want to sit still, head off into the Amazon or any of the country's other many inland jungles, snow-capped volcanoes, rocky deserts, endless plains, lush valleys, coffee plantations, mountain lakes, deserted beaches. For culture, intellectual Bogotá might lead the rest of Latin America in experimental theater, indie-rock, and the number of bookstores, but you could also get a completely alien education in an Amazonian malocca, or you could delve into the huge Latin music scene of salsa and cumbia, with the most exciting dance display being the enormous Carnival of Barranquilla. For history, wander the narrow streets of South America's original capital in Bogotá, check out old Spanish colonial provincial retreats like Villa de Leyva, trek through the thick jungle-covered mountains of the northeast to the Lost City of the Tayrona Indians, and walk the walls of Cartagena's achingly beautiful old city, looking over the fortified ramparts upon which the colonial history of South America pivoted. For nightlife, hot Cali is today's world capital of salsa, claiming that competitive distinction over Colombia's other vibrant big-city party scenes, which keep the music going long into the small hours of the morning. The hipsters' playground is found around the El Poblado neighbourhood in Medellín downtown. For dining, you'll find everything from the ubiquitous cheap, delicious Colombian home-style meals to world-class upscale and modern culinary arts in the big cities, with cuisines from all corners of the world represented. And for relaxing, there are gorgeous tropical beaches along Colombia's Caribbean and Pacific coasts, but you can find even more laidback and peaceful retreats on the idyllic and unspoilt Caribbean island of Providencia. The political violence has subsided substantially throughout the majority of the country and savvy travelers have already flocked here from around the world—come before everyone else catches on!"
CRI,"Costa Rica is a small country in Central America. This nation has bewilderingly diverse culture, climates, flora, and fauna, and landscapes range from rainforests, to dry tropical and temperate forests, to volcanoes, to Caribbean and Pacific beaches, to high mountains, and marshy lowlands. Costa Rica is an exceptionally stable and peaceful country compared to the volatile region it's in, and is one of the world's top destinations for nature and ecotourism. Owing in part to its comparative wealth, it can be a bit more expensive than its northern neighbors."
HRV,"Tourism in Croatia is a major industry of country's economy, accounting for almost 20% of gross domestic product (GDP).  The history of tourism in Croatia dates back to its time as part of Austria-Hungary when wealthy aristocrats would converge to the sea, but had expanded greatly in the 1960s and 70s under the economic policies of the former Yugoslavia. Today, Croatia is one of the most visited tourist destinations in the Mediterranean, with a total of 19.6 million tourists visiting in 2019.  Tourism in Croatia is concentrated in the areas along the Adriatic coast and is strongly seasonal, peaking in July and August. Eight areas in the country have been designated national parks, with an additional eleven as nature parks. Currently, there are ten sites in Croatia on the UNESCO List of World Heritage Sites."
CYP,"Cyprus (Greek: Κύπρος, Turkish: Kıbrıs) is an island in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, south of Turkey. It offers beautiful beaches and extensive historical and archaeological sites. There are three politically distinct areas in the island: the Republic of Cyprus (a member of the European Union) is a state with wide international recognition. However it only controls territory in the south. The Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus is functionally a separate country, though it receives diplomatic recognition only from Turkey. The British military sovereign base areas of Akrotiri and Dhekelia, while legally separate from either republic, have open borders with the Republic of Cyprus."
DNK,"Denmark (Danish: Danmark) is the smallest of the Nordic countries in terms of landmass. Once the seat of Viking raiders and later a major north European naval power, the Kingdom of Denmark is the oldest kingdom in the world still in existence, but has evolved into a democratic, modern, and prosperous nation. These days, the Danish Vikings have parked their ships in the garage and put the helmets on the shelves, and along with the other Scandinavian nations, have forged a society that is often seen as a benchmark of civilisation; with progressive social policies, a commitment to free speech so strong it put the country at odds with much of the world during the 2006 cartoon crisis, a liberal social-welfare system and, according to The Economist, one of the most commercially competitive. Top it off with a rich, well-preserved cultural heritage, and the Danes' legendary sense of design and architecture, and you have one intriguing holiday destination. Dubbed in various surveys and polls throughout the years as the ""happiest country in the world"", it is often pictured as a romantic and safe place, likely linked to Hans Christian Andersen as a ""fairy tale"" on its own. Of course much more lies beneath the surface, but for the traveller, Denmark is likely to prove convenient, safe, clean, but also quite expensive to visit."
DOM,"The Dominican Republic (Spanish: República Dominicana) is a Caribbean country that occupies the eastern half of the island of Hispaniola, which it shares with Haiti. Besides white sand beaches and mountain landscapes, the country is home to the oldest European city in the Americas, now part of Santo Domingo."
ECU,"Ecuador is a country on the Equator in northwestern South America. Several places in the country have been declared UNESCO World Heritage Sites, including the Galapagos Islands and the cities of Quito and Cuenca, which lie in the Andes that run from north to south through the country. The Ecuadorian Andes are also home to some of the highest active volcanoes such as the Cotopaxi."
EGY,"The Arab Republic of Egypt (Arabic: مصر, màSr) is in north-eastern Africa. Egypt is perhaps best known as the home of the ancient Egyptian civilization, with its art, temples, hieroglyphs, mummies, and above all, its pyramids. Less well-known is Egypt's Coptic Christian and Muslim heritage, with ancient churches, monasteries and mosques dotted across the landscape. Egypt stimulates the imagination of tourists like few other countries."
SLV,"El Salvador is a country in Central America. Located halfway between Guatemala, to the northwest, and Honduras, to the northeast, the country has many natural riches, such as beautiful beaches on the Pacific coast, majestic forests in the mountains and striking volcanoes."
EST,"Estonia (Estonian: Eesti) is a Baltic gem offering visitors the chance to see a tiny dynamic land on the shores of the sea. The northernmost and smallest of the Baltic states, the country has charming old towns and heritage back to the Hanseatic League. Tallinn's medieval old town was built by the Germans in Middle Ages and is in magnificent condition, with the medieval city walls and towers almost completely intact, and it rates as one of Europe's best medieval old towns. Visitors can also experience an ex-Soviet republic that is now part of the European Union. Traces of the Soviet era are still there to be seen, e.g. Paldiski, a deserted Soviet army base that was once off-limits to Estonians themselves, can easily be visited on a day trip from the capital, Tallinn. Estonia is renowned for its bucolic islands and extensive bogs that are now national parks with easy access for tourists. Glorious beaches pepper the extensive coastline, although the swimming season is short—after all, the Baltics are not renowned for warm weather."
ETH,"Ethiopia (Amharic: ኢትዮጵያ ʾĪtyōp yā) is Africa's third-most populous country (after Nigeria and Egypt), oldest independent country and one of only two (the other Liberia) never to be colonized, save for a short Italian occupation in the 1930s and 1940s."
FIN,"Finland (Finnish: Suomi, Swedish: Finland) is one of the Nordic countries in northern Europe. The country has comfortable small towns and cities, as well as vast areas of unspoiled nature. About 10% of the area is made up by 188,000 lakes, with a similar number of islands. Finland extends into the Arctic, where the Northern Lights and the Midnight Sun can be seen. The mythical mountain of Korvatunturi is said to be the home of Santa Claus, and there is a Santaland in Rovaniemi. While Finland is a high-technology welfare state, Finns love to head to their summer cottages in the warmer months to enjoy all manner of relaxing pastimes including sauna, swimming, fishing and barbecuing during the short but bright summer. Finland has a distinctive language and culture that sets it apart from both Scandinavia and Russia. While Finnish culture is ancient, the country only became independent in 1917, shortly after the collapse of the Russian Empire."
FRA,"France is a country with which almost every traveller has a relationship. Many dream of its joie de vivre shown by the countless cafés, picturesque villages, and world-famous gastronomy. Some come to follow the trail of France's great philosophers, writers and artists, or to immerse in the beautiful language it gave to the world. Others still are drawn to the country's geographical diversity, with its long coastlines, massive mountain ranges and breathtaking farmland vistas. France has been the world's most-visited country for over twenty years. It received 89 million visitors in 2018. All these people come to France for many a reason: its cities contain some of the greatest treasures on the continent, its countryside is prosperous and well-tended, and it boasts dozens of major tourist attractions, including Europe's most popular, Disneyland Paris. France is one of the most geographically diverse countries in Europe, containing areas as different from each other as urban chic Paris, the sunny French Riviera, windswept Atlantic beaches, the snowy resorts of the French Alps, the Renaissance châteaux of the Loire Valley, rugged Celtic Brittany and the historian's dream that is Normandy. A country known for rich emotions, turbulent politics, rational thinking, and Enlightenment treasures; whatever you want from a holiday, you're about to find it in France."
GEO,"Georgia (Georgian: საქართველო, Sakartvelo) is a country in the Caucasus. Sandwiched between Russia in the north and Turkey in the south, it sits along the coast of the Black Sea around where Europe and Asia meet. It is a rather mountainous country and is home to some of Europe’s highest mountain peaks. Despite its modest size, Georgia presents a large mix of other landscapes and micro-climates, ranging from dry wine-growing valleys in the east, to lush Black Sea resorts in the west. In Greek mythology, Georgia, known as Colchis, was the site of the famous Golden Fleece sought by Jason and the Argonauts. The tales of Georgia's ancient history are not without foundation; modern archaeological evidence suggests that Georgia is the oldest wine-making country in the world, with some wine samples dating back to 6,000 years BC. In testament to this rich heritage, Georgia's cities and countryside are complete with medieval churches, several of which are UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Enjoying low levels of crime and corruption, since the mid-2000s Georgia has developed into a fast-growing destination. The country's tourist infrastructure continues to expand."
DEU,"Germany (German: Deutschland), officially the Federal Republic of Germany (Bundesrepublik Deutschland) is the largest country in Central Europe. Germany is politically, economically and culturally influential, and is the largest European Union member state by population and economic output. Known around the world for ""German engineering"" as well as world leading banking and insurance companies, it is equally admired by visitors for its old-world charm and Gemütlichkeit (cosiness). Discard any perceptions of Germany as simply homogeneous, and a country of surprising regional diversity awaits."
GHA,"Ghana is a country in West Africa whose good infrastructure, political stability and widespread use of English make it a gratifying destination for first-time visitors to Africa (it's sometimes called ""Africa for beginners""). The people are generally very helpful and welcoming. While their laid-back attitude and a lack of organised tourist sights or trips can be a little annoying to begin with, you'll quickly realise that it is one of the delights of this country. Tourism in Ghana is growing very quickly, and tour operators are seeing increased requests for Ghana as a travel destination. Ghana has gold mines, and is a stable country with good potential for growth."
GRC,"Greece (Greek: Ελλάς, Hellas or Ελλάδα, Ellada) is a country rich in history, culture and natural beauty. Ancient Greece was one of Europe's first urban civilizations, and the origin of much of the arts, language, philosophy, politics, and sports of western society. The cultural heritage and spectacular mountains and beaches draw tourists from far away. Much of the country consists of peninsulas and islands in the Aegean, Ionian, and Mediterranean Seas."
GTM,"Guatemala has a rich and distinctive culture from the extended mixing of elements from Spain and the Maya people who are native to Central America. This diverse history and the natural beauty of the land have created a destination rich in interesting and scenic sites. Guatemala is very tough land—you can experience volcanic activity, seismic activity (earthquakes, mudslides), and hurricanes."
HND,"Honduras has colonial villages (Gracias, Comayagua), ancient Maya ruins (Copán), natural parks (Moskitia), and a Pacific and Caribbean coastline and the Bay Islands, with great beaches and coral reefs where snorkeling and diving are exceptional by any standard. The second-biggest country in Central America, Honduras presents gigantic variety for traveling. The Mayan Ruins in Copan. Good amenities can be found in cities like Tegucigalpa, San Pedro Sula, La Ceiba, Tela, Utila, Roatán and at Copán Ruinas, but elsewhere conditions can be quite basic, especially in the rural areas. You can find good hotels even in small towns if you are willing to pay a bit more (Honduras is not really an expensive country). Nevertheless a visit is worthwhile, especially to the ancient Maya ruins in Copán Ruinas, the colonial towns of Gracias and Comayagua, and the fantastic Caribbean Coast."
HUN,"(Hungarian: Magyarország) is an EU member state featuring a gorgeous capital city, Budapest, and the largest lake in Central Europe, Balaton. Hungary offers many diverse destinations: relatively low mountains in the north-west, the Great Plain in the east, lakes and rivers of all sorts, and many beautiful small villages and hidden gems of cities. Top this off with Hungary's great accessibility in the middle of Europe, a vivid culture and economy, and you get a destination absolutely worth visiting if you're in the region."
ISL,"Iceland (Icelandic: Ísland) is an island nation in the north Atlantic Ocean. Iceland is one of the Nordic countries, and therefore culturally part of Europe. The name Iceland is a misnomer: while glaciers cover 10% of the land, the climate is mild for its latitude, and volcanic activity keeps the country warm. Settled during the Viking Age, Iceland has the world's oldest surviving parliament, the Alþingi. It is known as the Land of Fire and Ice."
IND,"India (Hindi: भारत or Bhārat), the largest country in South Asia, has many of the world's highest mountains, most populated cities, and longest rivers. India's heritage and culture is a rich amalgam of the past and present. This vast country, the second most populous in the world and set to become number one, offers the traveller a view of fascinating religions and ethnography, a smorgasbord of languages, and architectural masterpieces that were built millennia ago and remain intact today. As the nation opens up to a globalised world, India still has a depth of history and intensity of culture that awe and fascinate the many who visit there."
IDN,"Indonesia is a huge archipelago of diverse islands scattered over both sides of the Equator between the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean. With an extensive, but quickly carved out amount of green forests on all of its islands and halfway between the poles, Indonesia is nicknamed The Emerald of the Equator."
IRN,"Iran (Persian: ایران), formerly Persia, can be considered part of the Middle East or Central Asia; indeed the Persian Empire was the dominant Central Asian power for many centuries. The wellspring of one of the world's great civilizations, Iran is a country of striking natural beauty and gorgeous tiled mosques. Once the centre of a pro-Western monarchy, it became an Islamic Republic in 1979, and since then, its history has been tumultuous.  Iran is a melting pot of different cultures, with Persians, Azerbaijanis, and Kurds constituting the largest ethnic groups. Shia Islam is the state religion, although there is a sizeable portion of Sunnis."
IRL,"Ireland (Irish: Éire), also known as the Republic of Ireland (Irish: Poblacht na hÉireann), has a rich culture that, along with its people, has been exported around the world. Gaelic culture is alive and well; one way to experience it is to go to a pub which has a traditional music session on. The Irish language has declined and English is now the most common language, though there are still certain areas where Irish is the primary language. It can be worth your while to dig a little deeper before visiting Ireland to discover something about the older world that lies beneath. It is still living, though not always visible. Some Irish history has been very dark indeed, but it remains a land of poets, story-tellers, and musicians, with marvellous scenery, an advanced knowledge economy, first-rate infrastructure, and leading industries, with a high gross domestic product and standard of living."
ISR,"The State of Israel (Hebrew: מדינת ישראל Medinat Yisra'el; Arabic: دولة إسرائيل) is a small yet diverse Middle Eastern country.  The modern State of Israel was established in 1948 as a homeland for the Jewish people, but the region contains thousands of years of history for many peoples and religions in addition to the Jews. Israel is considered part of the Holy Land (together with areas of Jordan, Egypt and the Palestinian territories). The three major Abrahamic religions of Judaism, Christianity and Islam, as well as the Baha'i faith, were founded or have strong ties to this land, and their holy and historic sites are major destinations for pilgrims and tourists from around the world. The Israeli population is about 74% Jews, 21% Arabs, and 5% non-Arab Christians and others. Most of the Jews are descended from Olim (""returnees"" from the Jewish Diaspora), and their diverse origins (Russian, German, Moroccan, Yemenite, and Ethiopian, to name a few of the prominent ones) can be seen in various aspects of modern Israeli culture. In contrast to its long ancient history, Israel is a highly urbanized, economically developed, first-world society. Unfortunately it is still in conflict with the Palestinians and some of its other Arab neighbors, and sometimes you will see signs of these tensions, but you will almost never be in danger (though there are places you should be more cautious like the West Bank). Although it's in Asia, due to hostility from the Arab countries, Israel participates in European rather than Asian regional bodies. Since 1967, Israel has controlled most of the West Bank (often called ""Judea and Samaria"" in Israel) as well as the Golan Heights. Israel has annexed East Jerusalem and the Golan, but most other countries, except the United States, reject the annexation, and consider these areas and the West Bank (which Israel did not annex, and Israeli law does not apply to the area) to be occupied Palestinian territory. Wikivoyage takes no stance on these political issues, but notes that in practice, current visitors to these areas will need Israeli visas and permits."
ITA,"Italy (Italian: Italia), officially the Italian Republic (Repubblica italiana), was once the core of the mighty Roman Empire, and the cradle of the Renaissance. It is also home to the greatest number of UNESCO World Heritage Sites in the world, including high art and monuments. Italy is famous for its delicious cuisine, trendy fashions, luxury sports cars and motorcycles, diverse regional cultures and dialects, as well as for its various landscapes from the seas to the Alps and Apennines, which makes reason for its nickname Il Bel Paese (the Beautiful Country)."
JAM,Jamaica is an island nation in the Caribbean.
JPN,"Japan, known as Nihon or Nippon (日本) in Japanese, is an island nation in East Asia. Its insular character has allowed it to develop a unique and very intricate culture, while its closeness to other ancient Far Eastern cultures, in particular China, has left lasting influence. Despite belonging to a nation long at war, both internal and foreign, Japan's people have always placed emphasis on inner balance, tranquility and natural beauty. These traditional values have become increasingly important now that Japan has grown to be one of the world's most densely-populated countries, and its legendary work ethic makes life in its cities quite hectic. Japan's sophisticated cuisine has spread to all corners of the world, but it is only in the country of its birth where you can appreciate its true form. Even more fascinating is the country's popular culture, which has developed a fandom all over the world, in particular manga comics and anime cartoons — with the Japanese taking their affinity for their favorite characters and themes to the extreme. In the 20th century, Japan enjoyed impressive economic growth, putting it among the world's most affluent nations today. This was mostly driven by rapid modernization and specialization in high technology. Japan is now full of contrasts between the living tradition and much cherished heritage, and its ultra-modern infrastructure, buildings and facilities. While the Japanese are known to be reserved and their language skills are not their strongest asset, they will go out of their way to make you feel a welcome visitor. Japanese retail businesses are also known for their legendary customer service, and visitors from overseas are often surprised at the lengths service staff would go to satisfy the demands of customers."
JOR,"Jordan (Arabic: الأردنّ al-Urdunn) is an Arab kingdom in the Middle East, at the crossroads of Asia, Africa and Europe. The capital, Amman, is Jordan's most populous city and the country's economic and cultural centre. Jordan has a large collection of archaeological sites, ranging from important biblical attractions to temples carved into the rock."
KAZ,"Kazakhstan is the largest of the states of the former Soviet Union apart from Russia, and it dwarfs the other countries of Central Asia. Kazakhstan is the richest country in the region due to its large oil and natural gas reserves and is also the largest in Central Asia. And while the endless, featureless steppe might repel some visitors the emptiness and mystery of this goliath state keeps many others captivated."
KEN,"The East African country of Kenya is a pearl in sub-Saharan Africa. From the scenic sandy beaches at the coast, to the Nairobi National Park (the only one in a capital city in the world), to the majestic Rift Valley, the bird life in Lake Naivasha, the hot boiling springs of Lake Baringo, Lake Turkana and Lake Victoria, Kenya is a very beautiful country with lots of wildlife and scenic features, and is one of the major economic hubs in Africa."
KWT,"Kuwait (Arabic: الكويت) is a monarchy situated at the Persian Gulf, nestled between Iraq and Saudi Arabia. Historically, Kuwait was a strategic trade port between Mesopotamia, India, and Persia. Like many of its neighbours, Kuwait is endowed with oil and gas wealth."
LVA,"Latvia (Latvian: Latvija) is one of the three Baltic states in Europe. The biggest travel destination in the country is the capital Riga, whose Old Town is a World Heritage Site. There are many other great places to see, both urban and rural. Latvia's unspoilt sea coast is a 500-km-long unique biome, mainly consisting of empty beaches, whitest soft sands, dunes covered with pine trees, sandy cliffs, and pine forests. Forests cover approximately half of Latvia's territory and are home to many nature trails, nature parks and wildlife preserves. The city of Liepāja with its magnificent beach and the unique formerly secret military neighbourhood of Karosta, Kuldīga with Europe's widest waterfall, and Cēsis with its medieval castle ruins are just some of the various sights."
LBN,"The tourism industry in Lebanon has been important to the local economy historically and to this day comprises a major source of revenue for the country. Before the Lebanese Civil War, Beirut was widely regarded as ""The Paris of the Middle East"" or also ""The Pearl of the Middle East"" often cited as a financial and business hub where visitors could experience Levantine Mediterranean culture, cuisine, history, archaeology, and architecture of Lebanon. From Stone Age settlements to Phoenician city-states, from Roman temples to rock-cut hermitages, from Crusader Castles to Mamluk mosques and Ottoman hammams, the country's historical and archaeological sites are displayed all across the country, reflecting thousands of years of world history. In addition to physical attractions, Lebanon has a long-standing history of cultural tourism. Outsider interest in Lebanese and Levantine culture was especially stirred following the visits of many European orientalists, scholars, and poets, particularly Alphonse de Lamartine, Ernest Renan, and Victor Guérin. Lebanon's diverse atmosphere and ancient history make it an important destination, and the country is slowly rebuilding itself after continued turmoil. Lebanon offers plenty: from ancient Roman ruins, to well-preserved castles, limestone caves, historic Churches and Mosques, beautiful beaches nestled in the Mediterranean Sea, world-renowned Lebanese cuisine, nonstop nightlife and discothèques, to mountainous ski resorts. Significant private investment is currently being made in the modernization and expansion of the tourism sector, such as in hotels catering to international travelers. Casino du Liban, which historically constituted a major tourist destination, reopened in 1996. The largest ski resort in the country has been expanded and modernized. The Government believes that, because of the return of peace and stability to the country following the civil war, and with the development of the necessary infrastructure, tourism will again contribute significantly to Lebanon's economy. Lebanon's tourism industry also relies on the large number of Lebanese living abroad, who return regularly to the country during the summer season."

MLT,"Malta is an island country forming an archipelago in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea. Positioned between Sicily and North Africa, the country is the smallest member of the European Union by population, with only half a million people, but also by area, making it the fourth-most densely populated country in the world while being the tenth-smallest. Despite its diminutive size, Malta is an important freight trans-shipment point, financial centre and tourist destination. Thanks to its strategic position, Malta has been continuously inhabited since prehistoric times, as well as conquered by pretty much all the civilisations with interest in Mediterranean domination, including the Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Romans, Byzantines, Arabs, Sicilians and, most recently, the British. All of them, as well as intensive trading across the region, left both material and cultural heritage on the islands, but the Maltese and their language remains unique in great many ways. With universal knowledge and use of English among the population and a wealth of both man-made structures from all eras of human existence and sites of exceptional natural beauty, Malta has been a very popular holiday destination for decades. There are also a number of aquatic activities to enjoy. Northern Malta is home to the country's beach resorts and holiday areas. Gozo and Comino, the country's two smaller islands, are also popular beach spots, although these tend to be quieter, rockier and better for snorkelling. The Mediterranean Sea surrounding Malta is popular for diving, and experienced divers may be able to find historical artefacts from World War II or earlier."

NLD,"The Netherlands (Dutch: Nederland) is a charming small country in the low-lying river delta of northwestern Europe. Its landscape of famously flat lands, much of it reclaimed from the sea, is dotted with windmills, blooming tulip fields and picturesque villages. With over 17 million people living in a relatively small area, this is a densely populated modern European country. Still, even the largest of its cities have retained a rather laid-back small-town atmosphere and many are packed with historic heritage. The country is commonly referred to as Holland, but this name refers only to two of its twelve provinces and is unpopular among Dutch people who aren't from North or South Holland. After the Eighty Years' War (1568-1648) that led to the country's de facto independence from Spain in 1581, the Netherlands became a great naval power and one of the world's most powerful nations in a period known as the Dutch Golden Age. Because of its naval and trading history, this small nation boasts a wealth of cultural heritage visible in many towns across the country. This period also constituted a cultural peak that produced renowned painters like Rembrandt and Vermeer. Their works and many others fill the top-class Dutch museums that attract hundreds of thousands of visitors each year. Over the course of centuries, the Netherlands has gained a reputation for tolerance and progressivism: the country was the first in the world to legalize same-sex marriage and Dutch people generally have an open attitude to cannabis and prostitution. As a founding member of the EU and NATO and host to the International Court of Justice in The Hague, the Netherlands is at the heart of international cooperation. With its international airport Schiphol and its advanced network of motorways and international high speed train lines, the Netherlands is easy to reach from anywhere. Its small size, welcoming attitude and interesting sights make it a unique and easy to discover destination and a great addition to any European trip."
NZL,"New Zealand (Māori: Aotearoa) is one of the most beautiful countries in the world, a country of stunning and diverse natural beauty: jagged mountains, rolling pasture land, steep fiords, pristine trout-filled lakes, raging rivers, scenic beaches, and active volcanic zones. These islands form a unique bioregion inhabited by flightless birds seen nowhere else, such as kakapo and kiwi. New Zealanders have adopted the kiwi as a national symbol, and have even taken the word Kiwi as a name for themselves. The islands are not densely populated, the South Island even less so than the North Island, but they are easily accessible. The country has modern visitor facilities and transport networks that are reasonably well developed. New Zealand often adds an adventurous twist to nature. It is the original home of jet-boating through shallow gorges as well as bungy jumping off anything high enough to give a thrill. Māori culture continues to play an important part in everyday life and the identity of the nation. Government and corporate New Zealand is full of Māori symbolism. There are abundant opportunities for visitors to understand and experience the history and present-day forms of Māori life."
NIC,"Nicaragua is the largest country in Central America by area and the least densely populated. Nicaraguans (or ""Nicas"" as they are often called) like to refer to their country as the ""país de lagos y volcanes""; the country of lakes and volcanoes. And those are indeed striking features as Nicaragua contains the largest freshwater body in Central America, Lake Nicaragua or Cocibolca. Inside Lake Nicaragua the famed Volcano Concepcion on Ometepe rises to about a mile in altitude, but other volcanoes such as Momotombo or Mombacho are also impressive."

Rich in diversity and landscapes, the country is home to more than 250 ethnic groups and 500 languages. The Hausa are the largest ethnic group, who make up more than 30% of the population.  Nigeria is divided roughly in half between Muslims (who are mostly found in the north and make up between 50-53% of the population) and Christians (who are mostly found in the south). The majority of Nigerian Muslims are Sunni Muslims, and the majority of Nigerian Christians are Protestants. Nigeria has the fifth largest Muslim population in the world, and the sixth largest Christian population in the world.  Nigeria does have its fair share of political and social problems, but don't let that deter you; the country is endowed with a plethora of appealing tourist attractions, incredibly friendly, jovial, and sociable people, and delicious food, and travel provides you the chance to experience and explore one of the most fascinatingly diverse countries on the planet. There's lots to do and see in Nigeria."
MKD,"The Republic of North Macedonia (Macedonian: Северна Македонија, Severna Makedonija; formerly the Republic of Macedonia, also FYROM and FYR Macedonia, Macedonian: Македонија, Makedonija) is a landlocked country in the heart of the Balkans. The majority of the population is ethnic Macedonian and Orthodox Christian but there is also a significant Albanian Muslim minority.

NOR,"Norway (Norwegian: Norge or Noreg) is the westernmost, northernmost — and surprisingly also the easternmost — of the three Scandinavian countries. Among the Nordic countries only Finland stretches slightly further east. Norway is known for the complex and deep fjords along its west coast, as well as the midnight sun and Northern Lights. The overall impression of Norway is a country with ample space and unusually rugged landscape. While famous for its great fjords along the Atlantic, the interior also has great valleys, wide forests and fjord-like lakes. Norway is one of the most mountainous countries in Europe. Water in all varieties is perhaps what Norway is most characterised for: the endless coastline, the great fjords, countless waterfalls, crystal rivers, lovely lakes and numerous glaciers. Although the great outdoors is Norway's number one attraction, there are also many interesting and lively cities like Oslo and Bergen. Man-made attractions include Norway's cultural heritage as well as modern structures and architecture - often found in cities but also in terms of impressive engineering in remote corners."

PAK,"The Islamic Republic of Pakistan (Urdu: پاکستان) is a country at the crossroads of Western, Central, South and East Asia. Conceived as a separate homeland for Muslims in South Asia, the country's tourism industry had its heyday during the 1960s thanks to the Hippie Trail. Unfortunately, the country has been in a state of flux since the 1970s, with many countries declaring it unsafe to visit.  Despite this, Pakistan continues to attract tourists due to its unique, diverse cultures and landscapes. The history buff can rejoice at the vast number of ruins from ancient civilisations, such as Mohenjo-Daro, Harappa and Taxila; The architecture lover can feast their eyes at Mughal-era architecture; The adventurous traveller can try their luck at scaling the vast number of mountain peaks, including K2."
PAN,"Panama is the ""Crossroads of the Americas"", with a privileged position connecting North and South America and linking the Pacific with the Atlantic. The ease of travel and wide array of experiences make Panama one of the most attractive emerging tourism destinations in the world. In just one week, visitors can enjoy two oceans, experience the mountains and rainforest, learn about native cultures and take advantage of vibrant urban life. The capital, Panama City, is a modern, sophisticated metropolis that resembles Miami and has established commerce, arts, fashion and dining. The indigenous meaning of the country's name, ""abundance of fish"", reflects Panama's reputation as a paradise for water sports enthusiasts and eco-tourists. As the isthmus connecting two massive continents, Panama's flora and fauna is incredibly diverse. For example, Panama has been named the country with the most bird species in the world: over 900. Panama's many indigenous tribes are still thriving, living in the same ancient manner as their ancestors, making its cultural fabric exceptionally rich."
PRY,"Paraguay is a country of big rivers, green landscapes, folklore and a rich indigenous culture in central South America. It's relatively small compared to its neighbours, with an area of 406,752 km2: about the same size as Germany. Paraguay is lacking in world-famous attractions, and tourist-oriented establishments are few and far between. But those visitors who do come will be rewarded with a great experience of South America: colonial history, ruins of missions, vast wilderness, and a strong mix of European and indigenous cultures."
PER,"Peru (Spanish: Perú) is without a doubt one of the most captivating countries in South America. Home of the epic lost Inca citadel of Machu Picchu and the mind-blowing Nazca Lines, this country's unique past awakens the adventurer in travellers of all sorts. Its awe-inspiring scenery varies from the wild Amazon jungles to vast coastal deserts and the icy peaks of the Andes. Peru hosts a biodiversity rarely seen within the limits of a single country, with a list of spectacular wildlife far beyond the well-known llamas and circling condors. On top of all that, Peru's friendly, multi-ethnic people are a cultural treasure on their own. The enchanting mix of dozens of distinct indigenous groups and mestizos, all with their own colourful traditions and food delicacies, is an encounter you won't easily forget. In short, this is a country of unimaginable extremes where choosing your trip destinations may prove a true challenge. Whether you decide to go off the beaten track, follow in the footsteps of thousands of visitors before you who took the Gringo Trail along some of the best highlights, or go experience the jungle through a relaxing multiple-day Amazon boat trip - Peru is likely to amaze you in everything you do."
PHL,"The Philippines (Filipino: Pilipinas), officially the Republic of the Philippines (Republika ng Pilipinas), is an archipelago of more than 7,100 islands in Southeast Asia between the Philippine Sea and the South China Sea. The country has one of the world's longest coastlines with many fine beaches and excellent diving. There is great cultural diversity due to the many islands, many waves of immigration, and a mixture of foreign influences — the country has been trading with nearby nations for at least a thousand years and was a Spanish colony from the late 1500s to 1898, then American until 1946. It would take decades to visit and experience everything. Many locals speak English well and most of the others have at least some English. Food and accommodations are cheap, many destinations have excellent infrastructure, and the people are cheerful and friendly; perhaps the easiest way to recognize a Filipino abroad is to see who has the broadest smile. The Philippines is seeing a slowly growing number of visitors, however, it continues to lag behind its neighbors, having received only 8 million visitors in 2018, just a fifth of Thailand's draw, despite a population 40% larger. Westerners form a minority of visitors; most tourists are from China, Korea and Japan. The plight of tourism mostly stems from insurgencies and crime, but most parts of the country remain safe with common sense."
POL,"Poland (Polish: Polska) is a Central European country that has, for the last few centuries, sat at the crossroads of three of Europe's great empires. As a result, it has a rich and eventful history, and a strong basis for its booking tourism industry. Its heritage is reflected in its architecture, museums, galleries and monuments. Its landscape is varied, and extends from the Baltic Sea coast in the north to the Tatra Mountains in the south. In between, lush primeval forests are home to fascinating species of animals including bisons in Białowieża; beautiful lakes and rivers for various water-sports, the best known of which are in Warmińsko-Mazurskie; rolling hills; flat plains; and deserts. Among Poland's cities you can find the perfectly preserved Gothic old town of Toruń, Hanseatic heritage in Gdańsk and evidence of the 19th-century industrial boom in Łódź. Today's Poland has a very homogeneous society in terms of ethnicity, language and religion. The historical Republics of Poland, whose boundaries were very different from those of today, were very multi-cultural, and, for a period, Poland was known as Europe's most religiously tolerant. Poland held Europe's largest Jewish population, which was all but wiped out by the Holocaust of World War II and after the war by the anti-Semitic communist government. Poland's western regions, including large parts of Lower Silesia, Lubuskie and Zachodniopomorskie, were parts of neighbouring Germany at different periods of time. The natural border of mountain ridges separating Poland from its southern neighbours, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, did not stop the cultural influence (and periodic warring). In the Middle Ages, Poland was part of a powerful Commonwealth with Lithuania that governed much of today's Belarus and Ukraine. The cultural evidence of it can be found closer to the present-day borders. Lastly, the entire eastern half of Poland used to be controlled by the Russian Empire, and there was a strong Soviet influence during the communist era, leaving behind many traces in both culture and built heritage. Despite losing a third of its population, including a disproportionally large part of its elites, in World War II, and suffering many economic setbacks as a Soviet satellite state afterwards, Poland in many ways flourished culturally in the 20th century. Paving the way for its fellow Eastern bloc states, Poland had a painful transition to democracy and capitalism in the late 1980s and 90s. In the 21st century, Poland joined the European Union and has enjoyed continuous economic growth unlike any other EU country. This has allowed it to markedly improve its infrastructure and had a profound effect on its society. Creative and enterprising, Poles continually come up with various ideas for events and festivals, and new buildings and institutions spring up almost before your eyes, so that every time you come back, you are bound to discover something new."
PRT,"Portugal is on the western edge of the Iberian peninsula, with two archipelagos in the Atlantic Ocean. Despite its small land area, it has many landforms and climates between the Atlantic coast and the mountains.

QAT,"Qatar (Arabic: قطر; pronounced kut-ar or cutter) is a rich Arab state occupying a small peninsula extending into the Persian Gulf to the north of Saudi Arabia.

It is a country of great natural beauty and diversity and a rich cultural heritage, including a variety of ethnic, linguistic, and confessional groups. Romania enchants visitors with its scenic mountain landscapes and unspoilt rural areas, but also with its historic cities and busy capital. There has been significant development, especially since it joined the European Union in 2007. Still, it may surprise some of its visitors who are used to western Europe. It has six cultural and one natural UNESCO world heritage sites. Romania is a large country which can sometimes be shocking with contrasts: some cities are truly modern, while some villages can seem to have been brought back from the past. While it has significant cultural similarities with other Balkan states, it is regarded as unique due to its strong Latin heritage, reflected in every part of Romanian society from its culture to its language. Things for which Romania is famous include: the Carpathian mountains, wine, medieval fortresses, Dacia cars, Dracula, stuffed cabbage leaves (sarmale), the Black Sea, sunflower fields, painted monasteries and the Danube Delta."

Much of the Asian part, however, has more in common with Kazakhstan, Mongolia, or Northeast China than with Eastern Europe. Russia boasts a rich history and culture."

People typically come to Saudi Arabia for either the Hajj or Umrah and leisure tourism is still in its nascent stages. Saudi Arabia provides the tourist the opportunity to learn about one of the most conservative countries on the planet, and a country that has been prominently featured in the Qu'ran, Islam's holiest book.  The country enforces a very strict interpretation of Islamic (Sharia) law, even though minor relaxations have been adopted in the last few years, the most notable one being allowing women to drive. Visitors are generally required to respect local conventions and Islamic values, and non-Muslims are disallowed from entering certain areas.  You should not travel to Saudi Arabia if you are not prepared to accept numerous limitations on your freedom of expression and behaviour."

Serbia was developed as a tourist destination much later than neighbouring Croatia, although it is also a varied and beautiful nation. From the plains of Vojvodina that remind one of the scenes of 'Dr. Zhivago' in winter, to many mountains, lakes and ski resorts. Serbia is on the crossroads of European history and as such, it is a mix of cultures, ethnicity and religions. Its people are one of the most hospitable and welcoming and Belgrade was voted as one of the up-and-coming capitals of Europe. Serbia has a spirit and a soul that is rare to find coupled with melange of different cultures and a gusto for good living."

SVK,"Slovakia (Slovak: Slovensko) or the Slovak Republic (Slovenská republika) is a country in Central Europe. The main reasons to visit Slovakia are its natural beauty, vivid history and great opportunities for relaxation (and due to the small size of the country, it is quite easy to combine all three). Slovakia has nine national parks, which cover a relatively big portion of the country and feature the tallest part of the Carpathian Mountain Range, the High Tatras, which offer great opportunities for mountain and winter sports as well as great vistas. Geologically, a sizable part of Slovakia is made out of limestone, which in combination with many springs and rivers has resulted in formation of numerous caves (12 open to the public, several of which are UNESCO listed) and the beautiful rocky formations, canyons and waterfalls of the Slovak Paradise and Slovak Karst. Even outside these areas, there are some beautiful landscapes, and all of Slovakia is covered by thousands of well-marked hiking trails. For history lovers, Slovakia has the highest number of castles and chateaux per capita in the world, ranging from simple ruins to well-preserved habitable castles with furnishings, so if you are a fan of medieval history, look no further. There are also numerous Gothic and Baroque cities and towns across Slovakia, including the capital. There are also well-preserved examples of wooden folk architecture, including churches made entirely out of wood and the tallest wooden altar in the world. There are numerous mineral and thermal springs in Slovakia, and around some of these world-famous spas have been built that offer great curative therapies or just simple relaxation.

Turkey offers a wealth of destination varieties to travellers: from dome-and-minaret filled skyline of Istanbul to Roman ruins along the western and southern coasts, from heavily indented coastline against a mountainous backdrop of Lycia and wide and sunny beaches of Pamphylia to cold and snowy mountains of the East, from crazy ""foam parties"" of Bodrum to Middle Eastern-flavoured cities of Southeastern Anatolia, from verdant misty mountains of Eastern Black Sea to wide steppe landscapes of Central Anatolia, there is something for everyone's taste—whether they be travelling on an extreme budget by hitchhiking or by a multi-million yacht."
UGA,"Uganda was called the Pearl of Africa by Winston Churchill. It is home to one of the most diverse and concentrated ranges of African fauna including the highly endangered mountain gorilla and the endangered common chimpanzee. Uganda is accessible and affordable, but not up to the high tourism standards of more mature destinations such as Kenya or Tanzania, much less South Africa. This gives it more edge, more authenticity and less predictability. This does not mean danger (but see Stay Safe section below), rather greater opportunities for delight—and frustration. This is real Africa, the dirty urban bustle of Kampala bursting at the seams then giving way to lush subsistence farming and small villages. Roads are rough, people are friendly, everything seems to have a smell all its own, and not everything moves according to schedule or to plan. Most travellers come to track the critically endangered mountain gorilla, but other major draws are other primates such as chimpanzees, birding, visiting Murchison Falls, trekking the Rwenzoris and white water rafting near the source of the River Nile."
UKR,"Ukraine (Ukrainian: Україна) is a large country in Eastern Europe, and the second largest country in Europe. Ukraine boasts a very rich culture and history, with a plethora of activities for the budding traveller."
ARE,The United Arab Emirates (Arabic: دولة الإمارات العربية المتحدة) or simply the Emirates is a country rich in history and culture at the entrance to the Persian Gulf. It makes an easy starting point for travels in the Middle East.
USA,"The United States of America is a vast country in North America about half the size of Russia and about the same size as China. It also has the world's third-largest population, with more than 330 million people (in 2020). It includes densely populated cities with sprawling suburbs, and vast uninhabited areas of natural beauty. Representing the world's single largest economy with its history of mass immigration dating from the 17th century, it is a ""melting pot"" of cultures from around the world. Regarded as the most powerful and influential country in the world, it plays a dominant role in the world's cultural landscape, and is famous for its wide array of popular tourist destinations, ranging from the skyscrapers of Manhattan and Chicago, to the natural wonders of Yellowstone and Alaska, to the canyonlands of the Southwest, to the warm, sunny beaches of Florida, Hawaii and Southern California."
URY,"Uruguay is the second-smallest country in South America, wedged between Argentina and Brazil. The country is known for its colonial-era historic districts in Colonia and Montevideo, popular beaches on the Atlantic Coast, and beef production—a former meat processing plant in Fray Bentos is a world heritage site. Calmer and safer than its neighbors, Uruguay is a low-key, easygoing destination."
VEN,"Venezuela is a country in South America on the Caribbean Sea. The country is known for being the home of the Angel Falls (Kerepakupai Vená), the world's highest waterfall and one of Venezuela's major tourist attractions. The country has the world's largest oil reserves, although this hasn't exactly translated into prosperity and wealth for the vast majority of the population. The heavy dependance on oil exports, coupled with pervasive corruption, political unrest and instability, economic mismanagement, and irresponsible policies put forth by the government have badly damaged the economy. This has, in turn, lead to a deteriorating human rights situation, shortage of basic supplies, skyrocketing crime rates, and widespread unemployment and poverty. Due to the extremely high inflation rate, Wikivoyage does not provide prices in the national currency, the bolivar. Prices expressed in US dollars may be shown as ranges because of the variance between low official and higher unofficial exchange rates."
VNM,"Vietnam (Vietnamese: Việt Nam) is a country in Southeast Asia.  Despite the turmoil of the American War (called the Vietnam War internationally), Vietnam has emerged from the ashes since the 1990s and is undergoing rapid economic development, driven by its young and industrious population. Although less developed as a tourist destination compared to say, Thailand, with great food and a wealth of natural and cultural attractions, it has much to offer for the intrepid traveller."
YEM,"Yemen (Arabic: ٱلْيَمَن) is a country in the Middle East. Although it is rich in history and culture, the country has been in a state of flux since the 1980s. It is one of the least developed and poorest countries in the world. However, under less extreme circumstances, this vast, mountainous country has a lot to offer to the adventurous, thrill-seeking traveller. Yemen is a difficult country to get around, but the rewards for the persistent visitor are unforgettable. The Yemenis are very friendly and open, and tourists might find themselves being treated as celebrities here; in fact, they might be showered with a lot of hospitality and care, even if they unintentionally make a few cultural blunders."
ZMB,"Zambia offers travelers some of the world's best safari opportunities, a glimpse into ""real Africa"", and Victoria Falls, one of the World's Seven Natural Wonders and a UNESCO World Heritage Site."
ZWE,"Zimbabwe is a landlocked country in Southern Africa. For those looking to travel in Africa, Zimbabwe is a great starting place. It is rich in fauna (being home to the big five) and flora and has numerous ancient stone cities including the largest in Africa south of the Sahara, Great Zimbabwe. Its border with Zambia is formed by the Zambezi River which when in full flood drops as the world's largest curtain of falling water at the mighty Victoria Falls which is a major tourist attraction."
